				<p>Today, aside from serving as a hub for telecommunications across the city, the CN Tower has become a major tourist destination. Visitors can test their courage by walking across the glass floor 113 stories above the ground. The first of its kind in the world, the glass floor gives you that dare-to-walk-on-air experience, with only 2.5 inches of glass holding you 342 metres in the air. The glass floor is actually stronger than most commercial floors and has the strength to hold 38,556 kg (85,000 lbs) or 14 hippos! Or, if you dare, travel higher up the tower to the Sky Pod, another 33 storeys above ground.</p>
				<p>By Car:
					<br /> From the South or West: Follow the QEW into Toronto , where it turns into the Gardiner Expressway. Exit onto Spadina Avenue North and turn right onto Bremner Blvd.
					<br /> From the East: Take Highway 401 into Toronto and exit onto the Don Valley Parkway Southbound. As you approach Downtown, this will turn into the Gardiner Expressway. Exit at Spadina Ave. North and turn right onto Bremner Blvd.
					<br /> From the North: Take Highway 400 into Toronto , exiting onto Highway 401 West. Continue until you reach Highway 427 southbound. Follow Highway 427 to downtown via the QEW/Gardiner Expressway. Exit onto Spadina Ave. North and turn right onto Bremner Blvd.</p>
				<p>By Transit:<br />
				Your ultimate destination is Union Station. From there, the Tower is a short walk west along Front Street, or a 5 minute covered stroll along the SkyWalk<br /><br />

				<p>Canada&#8217;s Wonderland is Canada&#8217;s first and largest theme park featuring over 200 attractions, 68 thrilling rides, North America&#8217;s greatest variety of roller coasters, Splash Works, a 20-acre water park and live shows.</p>
				<p>At 306 feet (93.27 m) in the air, Leviathan is the tallest ride in the park, dropping riders at an intense 80 degree angle. Across the way, Behemoth has eight extreme drops, open air seating, high speed twists, turns and loops. The daring may want to be lifted 23 stories high and then dropped at 100 kilometres per hour aboard Drop Tower. Not to be outdone are Vortex, Canada&#8217;s first suspended roller coaster, an intense corkscrew design in The Bat, Skyrider&#8217;s shark curves and side-winding helix (standing up of course), Dragon Fire&#8217;s two 360-degree loops, the trek through Wonder Mountain aboard Thunder Run, Windseeker, a 301 ft swing ride, and let&#8217;s not forget the coaster that lives up to its name, The Mighty Canadian Minebuster, the largest and longest wooden coaster in Canada.</p>

				<p>Generations of children and adults have trooped through the museum since it first opened in 1914. With six million objects in its collections and 40 galleries of art, archaeology and natural science, the ROM offers a whole world to explore. Four giant carved totem poles rise in the centre of the stairwells; the largest is 24.5 metres (over 80 ft.) tall. The hands-on Biodiversity gallery offers families a fun interactive experience about the interdependence of people, animals and plants.</p>
				<p>To commemorate the late Elizabeth Samuel, Liza’s Garden is a contemporary secret garden of greenness and sustainability, installed on the south portion of the Philosopher’s Walk wing. Created by PLANT Architect Inc, the nearly-10,000-square-foot area offers a dynamic haven of greenery. Aside from aesthetic appeal, the garden is a practical landscape that reduces the heat island effect and provides shelter for birds and other small creatures. The garden can be viewed from c5 Restaurant Lounge, located at the pinnacle of the crystal.<br /><br />
